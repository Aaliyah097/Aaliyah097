### Hi there 👋

I've been making commercial [**Python**] 🐍 projects since 2019.
I'm instersted in [**Stock Excahnge**] 💸,  [**Logistics**] 🚛 and [**E-commerce**] 🛒 sectors.
I'd like to bring projects which help people everyday 🚀.

I prefer to stick to [**Domain Driven Desing**] in my projects, because from my point of view it is the only way to develop longterm projets focused on business needs.
In domain design I prefer [**OOP**] and [**Rich Models**] and [**FP**] in cross-domain (service) design.
But usually projects are driven by [**Database-First Approach**].

In Python my favourite library is [**abc**] 🥇.

At spare time i run the blog about [**Software Architecture**] <https://arcane-switch.com> 📖.
