### Hi there 👋

I've been making commercial [**Python**] 🐍 projects since 2019.
I'm instersted in [**Stock Exchange**] 💸,  [**Logistics**] 🚛 and [**E-commerce**] 🛒 sectors.
I'd like to bring projects which help people everyday 🚀.

I prefer to stick to [**Domain Driven Desing**] in my projects, because from my point of view it is the only way to develop longterm projets focused on business needs.

Also I prefer to start up with [**Database-First Approach**] because data is the most valuable part of modern applications.
